## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **FCC Unlock** | Switches the radio from CE to FCC mode for higher power and more channels |
| **4G Activation** | Sends 4G activation frames to the aircraft (serial read at runtime) — no status readback, experimental |
| **LED Control** | Reads the current lamp state and verifies it after LED on/off commands (DJI Fly and a linked aircraft are required) |
| **Device Info** | Attempts to query hardware and firmware version; response availability depends on the controller/proxy path |
| **Auto-FCC** | Waits for Home Point, applies the full FCC profile once, then stops its listener |
| **Auto-Updater** | Checks `danusha2345/FreeFCC` GitHub Releases and lets you download/install from the app |
| **LAN Diagnostic API** | Logs, live status, allowlisted app actions, and raw DUML request/response over HTTP on the controller's RFC1918 Wi-Fi address |
| **Local by default** | Internet is used for update checks/downloads; the LAN API stays inside the current Wi-Fi subnet and can be disabled in the Log tab |
| **Open Profiles** | Command frames are plain JSON files you can inspect and edit |
| **No Paid Activation** | No trial, tracking, or external licensing backend |

> **Note on altitude/distance/NFZ unlock:** This is **not possible** via DUML commands alone. The 120m CE altitude limit is enforced by the **DJI Fly app** via a C0 class runtime flag that overrides flight controller parameters on every connection. No FCC unlock app can bypass this — it requires modifying the DJI Fly app itself or flashing patched firmware. DUML parameter writes (cmd_set=3, cmd_id=0xF9) set the FC values, but the Fly app overrides them on every reconnect. There are three separate altitude layers (C0 class cap from the Fly app, no-GPS/ATTI ceiling from firmware, novice/beginner mode from firmware); only the firmware layers are DUML-addressable, and only the C0 class cap is the 120m limit users actually hit. There is no known way to bypass the C0 cap without modifying the DJI Fly app or flashing patched firmware.

## Compatibility

This fork has current live validation on DJI RC2. Upstream reports also cover RC Pro 2 and RC Plus RM700. The separate [freefcc-launcher](https://github.com/doesthings/freefcc-launcher) is an optional Windows USB/ADB installer for controllers without the RC2 SD-card workflow. Its additional RC Pro 2 firmware-swap path for 4G is explicitly unverified and is not required by FreeFCC itself.

| Drone | Controller | FCC | 4G | LED | Status |
|-------|-----------|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| DJI Mini 5 Pro | RC2 | Yes | No (no cellular module) | Yes | FCC + LED working |
| DJI Mini 4 Pro | RC2 | Yes | No (no cellular module) | Not tested | FCC working |
| DJI Mavic 4 Pro | RC Pro 2 | Yes | Yes (Cellular Dongle 2) | Not tested | FCC working |
| DJI Air 3S | RC2 | Yes | No (no cellular module) | Not tested | FCC working |
| DJI Neo 1 | RC2 | Yes | No (no cellular module) | Not tested | FCC working |
| DJI Neo 2 | RC2 | Yes | No (no cellular module) | Not tested | FCC working |
| DJI Avata 360 Enhanced Transmission edition | RC2 | Yes | Unknown (integrated IoT eSIM; testing required) | Yes | FCC + LED working; 4G endpoint reachable, profile unverified |
| DJI M30T | RC Plus RM700 | Reported working | Reported working | Reported working | [Upstream hardware report](https://github.com/doesthings/FreeFCC/issues/18); firmware details not supplied |
| DJI Matrice 350 | RC Plus | Expected, untested | Cellular hardware supported; profile unverified | Not tested | Hardware verification required |
| DJI Inspire 3 | RC Plus | Expected, untested | Cellular hardware supported; profile unverified | Not tested | Hardware verification required |
| Other RC2 aircraft | RC2 | Should work | Unknown | Unknown | FCC profile is universal |

The captured 4G profile is experimental and was derived from systems using external cellular hardware. DJI Avata 360 Enhanced Transmission edition instead has an integrated IoT eSIM module. FreeFCC can probe whether the controller exposes `/duss/mb/0x205`, but endpoint availability does not prove that the same 128-frame activation sequence is compatible. When the probe returns a short WA/WM identity, the legacy allowlist remains conservative (`wa341`, `wa233`, `wa234`, `wm630`); a freshly observed full `1581...` serial proceeds to the endpoint check.

Validated upstream on DJI RC2 firmware v10.00.0700; this fork was additionally exercised live on RC2 `rc331`. Future firmware can change the local proxy or DUML routing, so compatibility must be rechecked rather than assumed.

The former two-second FCC keepalive is no longer used. Auto-FCC holds one
port-`40007` listener until a CRC-valid `03:44` stream shows a fresh
`not recorded → recorded` Home Point transition, then closes it and performs
one complete FCC apply. An unexpected established-stream disconnect stops the
monitor instead of opening a disruptive reconnect loop; toggle Auto-FCC to
start a new session.

If you test it on a model or firmware version not listed here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/danusha2345/FreeFCC/issues) and let me know.

## Install Guide

The original flow was tested on Mini 5 Pro with RC2 firmware v10.00.0700. No PC is needed. The repository README is the maintained installation guide; the older `freefcc.duckdns.org` page is not currently authoritative.

### 1. Prep the SD card

**Format the microSD card in the RC2 first.** Insert the card into the controller, then go to the RC2's storage settings and format it. If you skip this, the RC2 won't let you browse files on the card.

Download the helper apps zip and the FreeFCC APK. Extract the zip, drop the APK into the extracted folder, then move the whole thing onto the microSD card. Stick the card into your RC2.

> The RC2 won't install apps from internal storage, only from the SD card. The card must be formatted in the controller itself before it can be browsed.

### 2. Install the helper apps

Swipe down from the top of the RC2 screen, tap the SD card notification, hit EXPLORE, and open your folder. Install these two without opening them:

- `01_PackageInstaller` - tap it, CONTINUE, INSTALL, DONE
- `02_FileManager` - same thing

### 3. Restart

Hold the power button to shut down, then power back on. This registers the package installer.

### 4. Install the launcher

Back into your folder on the SD card. Install `03_ATVLauncher` but don't open it yet.

### 5. Set up Edge Gestures

Install `04_Edge Gestures` and this time tap OPEN. Follow the prompts and grant the Accessibility service permission. Then:

- Disable the left gesture, keep only the right side
- Scroll down to "Swipe to the left", tap it
- Pick Application, then choose ATV Launcher

Now swiping right-to-left on the screen opens the launcher.

### 6. Install FreeFCC

Swipe from the right edge to open ATV Launcher. Open the Files app, find your folder, tap `FREEFCC.apk`, and install it.

## How to Use

1. Power on the drone and link it to the controller
2. Open FreeFCC and tap **Connect**
3. For automatic operation, enable **Auto-FCC** before Home Point is recorded. It opens DJI Fly, waits for a fresh Home Point transition, then sends the full FCC profile once. Manual **Send FCC Request** remains available for testing or recovery after Home Point.
4. For 4G diagnostics, tap **Probe 4G Endpoint** first. This is read-only and only checks whether `/duss/mb/0x205` is reachable. **Send 4G Activation Frames** remains experimental and confirms writes only, not activation.
   > **Note:** The integrated eSIM path on DJI Avata 360 is not yet proven compatible with the captured external-module profile. Please attach the LAN logs to an [issue](https://github.com/danusha2345/FreeFCC/issues) when testing.
5. To request CE restore, tap **Send CE Restore**. The app confirms transport writes only; verify the actual RF mode in DJI Fly.
6. The LED card reads state once after connection and verifies it after **LED ON** or **LED OFF**. Use refresh for one additional on-demand read.
7. The **Info** tab lets you query the controller's hardware and firmware version
8. The **Log** tab starts the LAN diagnostic API by default. It uses unencrypted HTTP and a fixed shared password. A UDP beacon broadcasts only the controller IP and port across the current Wi-Fi subnet; it does not include the password, logs, or command payloads. Disable the bridge on untrusted Wi-Fi. See [LAN Control API](docs/LAN_CONTROL_API.md).

## How Do I Know If It Worked?

Open the DJI Fly app and go to the Transmission tab. Look at the horizontal bar around -90 dBm:

- If it lines up with the **1km mark**, your drone is in **CE mode**
- If it falls **below** the 1km mark (extends further), your drone is in **FCC mode**

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>FCC Mode</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>CE Mode</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src=".github/fcc.webp" alt="FCC mode"></td>
<td><img src=".github/ce.webp" alt="CE mode"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" style="color:#34D399">Signal extends past 1km</td>
<td align="center" style="color:#7A85A3">Signal barely reaches 1km</td>
</tr>
</table>

> If the signal graph hasn't changed, power cycle the controller and try again. Make sure the drone is powered on and linked before enabling FCC.

## How It Works

For FCC, CE, and request/response diagnostics, the app sends DUML commands to localhost TCP proxies. RC2 normally uses `127.0.0.1:40009`; discovery also checks `40007` and `8901..8904` for other controller paths. DUML is DJI's internal command protocol, publicly documented in the [dji-firmware-tools](https://github.com/o-gs/dji-firmware-tools) project.

Each command is a small binary packet with a magic byte (`0x55`), routing fields, a payload, and two CRC checksums. Ordinary TCP commands use one packet per connection. LED commands use an outer wrapper on port `40007`; 4G uses one abstract Unix datagram socket for the complete frame burst.

The LED card keeps physical state separate from write completion. Its refresh action, and every LED write, perform one wrapped read-only `03:F8` hash request and display `ON`, `OFF`, `PARTIAL`, or `UNKNOWN`. A missing or mismatched response never preserves the requested value as if it were verified. See [LAN Control API](docs/LAN_CONTROL_API.md#read-the-current-lamp-parameter-by-hash).

### FCC Profile

21 frames sent in 2 rounds with 30ms between frames and 100ms between rounds. The sequence enters service mode, sets the radio region to FCC, writes channel groups and power limits, commits the change, and exits service mode. The same 21 frames work on every DJI aircraft model tested (Mini 5 Pro, Mini 4 Pro, Mavic 4 Pro, Air 3S, Neo, Avata 360). All requested writes must now complete before the UI reports that the sequence was sent. The proxy cannot confirm the resulting RF region, so verify the Transmission graph in DJI Fly.

The CE/default-region action is experimental. It writes the existing single-frame `ce_restore.json` profile, stops keepalive first, and reports only that the command was sent. Its effect must also be verified in DJI Fly.

### 4G Profile

128 frames sent in a single round with 10ms between each. Each frame carries the aircraft's serial number in its payload. The serial is read from the controller at runtime by listening for telemetry on the DUML socket.

The captured profile is confirmed only as an external-module protocol artifact. Mavic 4 Pro (`wa341`), Matrice 300/350 (`wa233`/`wa234`), and Inspire 3 (`wm630`) remain the conservative short-code allowlist. DJI Avata 360 Enhanced Transmission edition has an integrated IoT eSIM module; compatibility with this exact profile is a hypothesis pending live endpoint and traffic evidence.

**How the 4G activation frames are sent:**

Unlike FCC which goes through the standard DUML TCP proxy on port 40009, 4G frames are sent via a Unix domain socket at `/duss/mb/0x205` (abstract namespace). This is a DJI internal DUSS route, not proof of a particular physical modem type. The app opens one `LocalSocket` for the complete 128-frame burst, writes and flushes each frame, then closes the socket. No ACK is read back — the app can only confirm the frames were written, never that the aircraft activated 4G. A separate read-only button checks endpoint reachability without sending frames.

The frame format is:
- `sender = 2` (CAMERA)
- `cmd_type = 0` (Request, NO_ACK_NEEDED, no encryption)
- `cmd_set = 81` (0x51, 4G command set)
- `cmd_id = 0..127` (sequential, one per frame)
- `dst = 238` (0xEE, OFDM_GROUND index 7)
- `payload = 000000 + ASCII(aircraft_serial)`

The aircraft identity is probed by listening on the detected DUML TCP port for telemetry data. The preferred format is a full `1581...` factory serial. If it is not found within the listen window, the app falls back to the 5-character model pattern `W[AM]xxx` (for example `WA341` or `WM630`). Both forms are accepted by the 4G flow; a short identity can be checked against the model allowlist, while a full factory serial proceeds to the socket pre-check. The last identity is cached for display, but serial-specific 4G sending requires it to be freshly observed in the current process so a previous aircraft's cached value is not reused blindly.

The `/duss/mb/0x205` pre-check proves only local route availability. It does not distinguish an external Cellular Dongle from an integrated eSIM module and does not validate model-specific payload semantics.

### Profile Format

Profiles are JSON files in `app/src/main/assets/profiles/`. Each frame looks like this:

```json
{ "s": 16, "i": 88, "d": 18, "p": "030100", "note": "Enter service mode" }
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `s` | Command set (16 = service mode, 6 = radio, 3 = flight controller) |
| `i` | Command ID within the set |
| `d` | Destination device |
| `p` | Payload as hex string (sent as raw bytes, no transformation) |
| `note` | Plain English description of what the frame does |

You can open these files in any text editor, read every byte that gets sent, and modify them if you want.

### How the Frames Were Obtained

The DUML proxy on DJI controllers listens on `127.0.0.1:40009` and accepts plain unencrypted TCP connections. The command frames were identified by capturing loopback traffic on the controller while the radio was active, then extracting the `0x55`-prefixed DUML packets from the capture:

```bash
tcpdump -i lo -w /sdcard/capture.pcap port 40009
```

The frames are plaintext on the local socket with no encryption. Once captured, the payloads were decoded using the publicly documented command set and device type enums from the [dji-firmware-tools](https://github.com/o-gs/dji-firmware-tools) project (GPL-3.0). This project's `DumlBuilder` class implements the same CRC-8 (polynomial 0x8C reflected, init 0x77) and CRC-16 (polynomial 0x8408 reflected of 0x1021, init 0x3692) as the reference implementation to build valid frames from the decoded command definitions. The wire layout is: `[0]=0x55 magic, [1-2]=length, [3]=CRC-8, [4]=sender, [5]=dst, [6-7]=seq, [8]=cmdType, [9]=cmdSet, [10]=cmdId, [11..N]=payload, [N+1..N+2]=CRC-16`.

## Building

Requirements: Java 17+, Android SDK 35.

### Windows

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.18.8-hotspot"
$env:PATH = "$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;$env:PATH"

cd C:\projects\FreeFCC
java -classpath gradle\wrapper\gradle-wrapper.jar org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain assembleRelease --no-daemon
```

### macOS/Linux

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-17
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"

cd /path/to/FreeFCC
./gradlew assembleRelease --no-daemon
```

Run the local verification gates with:

```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug lintDebug
```

### Release signing

Release builds are **unsigned** by default. To produce a signed release APK, create a keystore and a local `keystore.properties` file (gitignored) pointing at it:

1. Generate a keystore (one-time):
   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias release
   ```
2. Copy `keystore.properties.example` to `keystore.properties` and fill in your keystore path and passwords.
3. Run `./gradlew assembleRelease` — the build picks up `keystore.properties` automatically and signs the APK.

CI builds can sign via repository secrets instead of the local file. Configure `SIGNING_KEYSTORE_B64`, `SIGNING_STORE_PASSWORD`, `SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS`, and `SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD`; the workflow creates `SIGNING_STORE_FILE` in the runner's temporary directory.

> **Important:** Android updates must be signed with the same certificate as the installed APK. Keep the release keystore stable. Changing the signing certificate requires uninstalling the existing app before installing the newly signed build.
